# OpenWoodChair

This is a fork of the [OpenWheelChair](http://www.openwheelchair.org/). We dropped the PVC pipes and use palette wood instead so that the wheelchair gets cheaper to build, targeting a wider audience especially in developing countries.

We implemented the BYU wheelchair during the 2016 Abilympics event in Bordeaux, France, and turned the pipes to wood during the Fabrikarium hackathon organized by MHKit in collaboration with the Airbus group in Octobre 2016 at the Airbus facility in Toulouse, France.
